# Collaborative Calendar

This project is a collaborative calendar web application.

Users can:
- Create groups
- Schedule events inside groups
- Invite other users to events
- View all their events in one dashboard

The goal of this project is to learn how real-world web applications
use databases, authentication, and concurrency control.
